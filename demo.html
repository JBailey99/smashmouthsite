			<p> Throughout my websites development I ensured that I applied the best standards and practices given by W3C so that my site functioned effectively and accurately across all browsers and platforms. The first thing I did before even creating my site was ensure that I had a suitable file organisation for my website, this was so any links in my HTML were relative to the current page and not pointing to locations on my local computer. This is good practice as if this wasn’t done then my site would have been full of broken links when I first uploaded it to a server, it also allows me to find all files associated with my website with relative ease. Another thing I did was name all the files in my root appropriately so that they could be referenced easily within my code.
			</p>
			<p>
				To develop the website, I used a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, a little bit of jQuery was also used to help with scripting. No in-line CSS or scripting was used in my HTML to make things easier to maintain and to help separate content from design, instead external files were used and were linked in the head tag of the HTML. The head also contained meta tags, an icon link and a title for the web page, the body tag contains all the content of the web page that is read by the browser. When coding using HTML, I ensured that I closed all tags that I opened and that there were no stray tags, this is to reduce errors within the code that could compromise the entire site. Many tags were also given ids and classes, these were given suitable names so that they could be easily referenced in the stylesheet and scripting. Any img tags used were given alt tags that described the image, this is required so that if the image for some reason does not load, the user still has an idea of what was supposed to be there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within my CSS I have used many media queries that alter parts on the sites based on screen width, I have done this to maximise the interoperability of my site. This is good practice as it allows my site to be responsive and look professional across all devices. However, one thing I could have done to increase the interoperability of my site is use relative values for sizes and distances such as em or %. In some instances I have used % but in most circumstances I have used pixels, this is an absolute unit meaning it doesn’t scale accordingly to the browser window because of this objects may look bigger than intended on certain devices. In future I will ensure I use relative units to increase the interoperability of my site.
			</p>
			<p>
				When it came to scripting, I used a combination of JavaScript and jQuery, these were used to make the website more dynamic and so that things like slideshows, customisers and local storage could be implemented into the site. At the top of my code is where all the global variables are located so that they can be accessed throughout the code, many functions are called from a window.onload function, this ensures that the DOM is loaded before the contained functions are called.
